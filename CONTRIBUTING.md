# Contributing Guidelines

This guide reflects how *I* run OpenClaw. Contributions are welcome, but the goal is clarity and correctness, not breadth or hype.

## Good contributions

- Fixes for upstream OpenClaw changes
- Corrections to inaccurate or outdated information
- Clarifications that improve understanding
- Additional examples that reinforce existing patterns

## Not accepted

- “Best model” lists
- Vendor evangelism
- Rewrites that change the tone
- Generic AI advice not specific to OpenClaw
- Expanding scope beyond the runbook’s intent

## Style

- Be specific
- Avoid hype
- Prefer boring, operational language
- Assume the reader will actually run this long-term

If in doubt, open an issue before submitting a PR.

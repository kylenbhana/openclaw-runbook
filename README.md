## 📘 About openclaw-runbook

This project provides a clear, steady guide for running OpenClaw software reliably. It helps you avoid unexpected errors, high costs, and confusion.

OpenClaw lets users work with AI models efficiently. However, it can be tricky to manage day to day without good instructions. This runbook shares tested steps based on real use, not theory or hype.

Key points:

- Written for users who want OpenClaw to run consistently for days or weeks.
- Focuses on cost control, system stability, and managing resources safely.
- Includes practical advice on how to set up coordinator and worker roles.
- Not a beginner tutorial or marketing page. It assumes some familiarity but no coding skills.

If you want flashy demos or quick wins, this guide is not for you. It aims for boring stability that works.

## 🛠 Common Tasks Explained

Here are explanations for the key topics you will handle with this runbook.

### Coordinator vs Worker Models

OpenClaw works by having one coordinator and one or more workers:

- The **coordinator** controls tasks and manages how work splits.

- The **workers** do the heavy AI processing.

This division helps keep the system stable and prevents overload.

The runbook shows you how to set this up, so your workers do not exceed memory or cost budgets.

### Cost Control

Running AI models online can get costly fast. The guide helps you set limits so OpenClaw doesn’t go beyond your budget.

You will learn to:

- Control API call rates

- Set daily or hourly cost caps

- Handle errors to avoid spending surprises

### Memory Boundaries & Guardrails

To prevent crashes or slowdowns, you set upper limits on memory use. These are called guardrails.

The runbook explains:

- How to set memory limits for each worker

- How to restart processes safely if limits are hit

- How to monitor usage effectively

---

## 💡 Tips for Smooth Operation

- **Always follow the order:** Breaking the steps or skipping sections can cause errors.

- **Monitor resources:** Use built-in tools to watch your CPU, memory, and costs.

- **Back up configs:** Save your configuration files each time you make changes.

- **Use recommended software:** Like Markdown editors for clear instructions.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If something does not work:

- Check internet connection and restart the computer.
